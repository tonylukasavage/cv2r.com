    <p>Castlevania II: Simon's Quest Randomizer (CV2R) is a new take on an old game. We shuffle around all the items, weapons, whips, Dracula parts, and just about everything else throughout the entire game! Will the Dracula's heart be for sale in Jovah? Will the Berkeley orb upgrade your whip? Will you have to kill Death just to get your holy water? Generate a randomized game and find out!</p>
